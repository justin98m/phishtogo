This was a project for a coworker as a secret Santa gift
It's Serverless to an extent. This application holds json containing information about a song they have added to the site
The songs carries information that includes the text to be displayed in the html, the color of the text and the url to the media.
There are two pages
  Page one displays the songs and allows for deletion of the songs
  Page two allows for adding to the songs
All the information is held in Json so to update the json the site sends information
to an API I built that has access to the aws s3 holding the json file.
The API will update the json based on the site's request and tell aws to update
the json for the Website.

I figure a database would be easier but I was interested in completing the site This

I'm hoping to build more static sites that leverage the same api so I can
have one application update content for multiple sites.
